# Causal-ML-vs-G-Methods
Causal machine learning in Python (random forest from econML package) contrasted with the g-methods in R (ipw and gfoRmula packages) using the same simulation that attempted to capture the complexity of real-world observational data.

This independent project is still in progress, and for a full disclaimer, Claude 3.5 Sonnet had greatly helped with my exploration of this comparison. 
Please refer to the corresponding package vignettes (EconML, ipw, and gfoRmula) for more reliable examples of these packages. I was curious to compare the outputs on the same simulation.
